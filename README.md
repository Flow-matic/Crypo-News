# Crypto News

The website is to show the latest news and gossips on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency from around the world. As cryptocurrencies transform how we trade, transact and interact online, it has become more important than ever for technology leaders to have experience with these innovations. I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast and I believe the technology along with blockchain, that is just a few years away, will be amazing.

___

Design
---
   * Colour Scheme

     * The two main colours for the website are dark-grey and pure-blue colour.
  
   * Typography

     * The Oswald font is the main font used throughout the website with sans-serif as the fall-back font in case there are any issues with the font not loading to the pages.

   * Imagery

     * Our brain can interpret images much quicker than text, which is why images are important to any website. The images used on the home page through to the news page and the sign-up page were chosen to have the information needed to understand what the website is about. 

     * The structure of the website code I used was from the "Love Running" Code Institute. I liked the way it looked and it was also user friendly. I also added some grid cards with external links to each one.
  
*  [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the wireframe for each of the pages.
